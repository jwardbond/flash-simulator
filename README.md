This project was done in collaboration with Jeff Byles, Xinlong Chen, and Joseph Nahas for the "Java for Chemical Engineers" course at University of Ottawa.

The goal was to develop a simulator that could perform ideal and non-ideal flash simulations under a variety of conditions. The Peng-Robinson equation of state was used for non-ideal flashes.
